      <p1>It was time for Thanksgiving on Copper-9, despite the fact that there were no seasons but winter, the drones still celebrated this holiday at this time of year, possibly as part of their emulation of humans. Our main characters N and Uzi participated in this as well; it would be the first holiday N spends with Uzi and her reunited family, and the first one that Nori’s had with her family in a while. There was a most joyous atmosphere in the Doorman household that night. After they had prepared some food and set the table, the four of them sat down; Uzi and N on one side, Nori and Khan on the other. N had experienced this holiday with humans before, and shared some Thanksgiving traditions he’d seen on Earth. To Uzi his voice was as song, and his face shone like the binary moons of Copper-9. He’d explained that the humans would each say something they’re thankful for on this night. Uzi stood up next to N, even without her saying so, it was apparent what she was thankful for. To N her voice felt oddly gentle, and her face was as beautiful as the glimmer of the “snow”. Khan and Nori also said what they are thankful for. All four of the drones were thankful for the same thing:</p1>
      <br />
      <p1>The fact that they were all together.</p1>
